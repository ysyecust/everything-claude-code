## Build System Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred build system (CMake/Make) and compiler (GCC/Clang) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_BUILD_SYSTEM` / `CLAUDE_CXX_COMPILER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/build-system.json`
3. **Project files**: CMakeLists.txt or Makefile detection
4. **Global config**: `~/.claude/build-system.json`
5. **Fallback**: First available (cmake > make, clang > gcc)

To set your preferred build system:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_BUILD_SYSTEM=cmake
export CLAUDE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++

# Via setup script
node scripts/setup-build-system.js --global cmake

# Detect current setting
node scripts/setup-build-system.js --detect

# List available options
node scripts/setup-build-system.js --list
```

---

## Ecosystem Tools

### Skill Creator

Two ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)

Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning
```

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

#### Option B: GitHub App (Advanced)

For advanced features (10k+ commits, auto-PRs, team sharing):

[Install GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/skill-creator) | [ecc.tools](https://ecc.tools)

```bash
# Comment on any issue:
/skill-creator analyze

# Or auto-triggers on push to default branch
```

Both options create:
- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### Continuous Learning v2

The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

```bash
/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills
```

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation.

---

## Requirements

### Claude Code CLI Version

**Minimum version: v2.1.0 or later**

This plugin requires Claude Code CLI v2.1.0+ due to changes in how the plugin system handles hooks.

Check your version:
```bash
claude --version
```

### Important: Hooks Auto-Loading Behavior

> **For Contributors:** Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is enforced by a regression test.

Claude Code v2.1+ **automatically loads** `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error:

```
Duplicate hooks file detected: ./hooks/hooks.json resolves to already-loaded file
```

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "everything-claude-code": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "affaan-m/everything-claude-code"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

> **Note:** The Claude Code plugin system does not support distributing `rules` via plugins ([upstream limitation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)). You need to install rules manually:
>
> ```bash
> # Clone the repo first
> git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
>
> # Option A: User-level rules (applies to all projects)
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/* ~/.claude/rules/
>
> # Option B: Project-level rules (applies to current project only)
> mkdir -p .claude/rules
> cp -r everything-claude-code/rules/* .claude/rules/
> ```

---

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git

# Copy agents to your Claude config
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy rules
cp everything-claude-code/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Copy commands
cp everything-claude-code/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills
cp -r everything-claude-code/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Add hooks to settings.json

Copy the hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope:

- **tdd-guide** - C++20 TDD with Google Test/Mock
- **build-error-resolver** - CMake, linker, template errors
- **code-reviewer** - Memory safety, RAII, performance
- **security-reviewer** - ASan/UBSan/TSan/MSan analysis
- **integration-test-runner** - CTest labels, MPI tests

### Skills

Domain knowledge for C++20 HPC:

- **coding-standards** - Naming, concepts, ranges, constexpr
- **hpc-patterns** - Cache-friendly data, SIMD, threading, NUMA
- **numerical-patterns** - Sparse matrices, CG/GMRES, HPC I/O
- **tdd-workflow** - Google Test parameterized tests, CMake integration

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(cpp|hpp|cc|h)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "clang-format --style=Google -i \"$file_path\""
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Always-follow guidelines for C++20:

- **security.md** - Buffer overflow, use-after-free, CWE Top 25
- **coding-style.md** - RAII, const correctness, move semantics
- **testing.md** - Google Test, 80% coverage, TDD workflow
- **patterns.md** - Result type, CRTP, Builder pattern

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
node tests/run-all.js

# Run individual test files
node tests/lib/utils.test.js
node tests/lib/build-system.test.js
node tests/hooks/hooks.test.js

# Run CI validation scripts
node scripts/ci/validate-agents.js
node scripts/ci/validate-commands.js
node scripts/ci/validate-hooks.js
node scripts/ci/validate-rules.js
node scripts/ci/validate-skills.js
```

---

## C++20 Features Covered

- **Concepts** - Type constraints and requirements
- **Ranges** - Composable algorithms and views
- **std::span** - Non-owning contiguous views
- **std::expected** - Error handling without exceptions
- **constexpr/consteval** - Compile-time computation
- **Structured bindings** - Decomposition declarations
- **Three-way comparison** - Spaceship operator

---

## HPC Patterns

- Cache-friendly data structures (SoA/AoS)
- SIMD vectorization hints
- Thread pool and lock-free containers
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- MPI communication patterns
- HDF5 and binary I/O

---

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged.**

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

### Ideas for Contributions

- Additional HPC patterns (GPU offload, heterogeneous computing)
- New solver algorithms (multigrid, domain decomposition)
- Build system integrations (Ninja, Meson)
- Profiling agents (perf, vtune, gprof)
- Additional sanitizer workflows

---

## Important Notes

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Your 200k context window can shrink to 70k with too many tools enabled.

Rule of thumb:
- Have 20-30 MCPs configured
- Keep under 10 enabled per project
- Under 80 tools active

### Customization

These configs work for C++20 HPC workflows. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your specific HPC stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
